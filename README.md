Logs are a rich source of information providing an insight into the system operation. However, the substantial size of logs makes it difficult to analyze them manually. Therefore, the attention of current research has focused on automatic processing and analysis of this information to discover system breaches. In this thesis, we propose a novel approach to log anomaly detection using Graph Neural Networks by converting the problem to a link prediction task and training the model to recognize the anomalous events in the system execution. We show that using this approach, we are able to discover malicious entities hidden in the system among benign activity.
